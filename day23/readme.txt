Obviously my part 1 solution wouldn't work when scaled up.
I admittedly had to google around for tips.  
But in the process learned about things like deque and how to make loops less expensive timewise.
The idea to use a dictionary was fully taken from reddit comments.
Overall, it was frustrating but also pretty fun to try to speed up my code.
